# Feature Selection AI Project

This project applies feature selection techniques on the Titanic and Breast Cancer datasets.  
Built as part of an Artificial Intelligence course.

## 🔍 Contents
- `SeleccionDeCaracteristicas.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with data exploration, feature selection, and model evaluation.
- `funciones.py`: Helper Python functions used in the notebook.
- `titanic.csv`, `BreastCancer.csv`: Datasets.
- `Memoria.pdf`: Full academic report (in Spanish).

## 🧠 Techniques Applied
- Univariate selection
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Tree-based feature selection
- Correlation analysis
- Model evaluation

## 🧪 Requirements
